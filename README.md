# ML-Lab-2

This is a repo of my ML's experiment. What I need to do is clustering analysis.

You can use `data_generate.py` to generate your data, here I use a seed 0.

You may need `numpy` , `scipy`,`matplotlib` and `sklearn`(optional) to run these code.

What I do is very naive cause I hardly write python... So there are lots of parts needing to be optimize, such as heap in Clink and kd-tree in DBSCAN. If you would like to do these, welcome.

Have fun. :)
